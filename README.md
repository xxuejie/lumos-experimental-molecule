# lumos-experimental-molecule

This library is copied over from [molecule](https://github.com/ckb-js/lumos/tree/develop/packages/molecule) in lumos repository. The original library is marked as private, hence having no published releases on npmjs. My guess is that the original library is not in mature state. Since I still want to use the library, I moved it over to a separate library here.
